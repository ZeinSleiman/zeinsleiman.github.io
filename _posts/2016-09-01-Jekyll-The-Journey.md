A year ago, I found about Jekyll browsing the internet and after reading about it, I thought to myself, I should use to build my blog. It looks really cool.

Few years ago, I wanted to build a profile page to have some presence on the internet, so I went and built a one page site using MVC .Net. Nothing special about the page and it didnt really need to use MVC since it was just a static page. The idea was I would add more to the site but I was very busy with work and never had time until recently.

Again the idea of building a blog came to me and while looking into the hundreds of options I found github pages and their ability to parse Jekyll. For me that was the sign that it is time to give Jekyll a try and build my blog using it.

What is Jekyll?
Jekyll takes your text and transform it into a static website. No need for databases. You write your blog post, add the file to your site, deploy it and using magic or code, the post will look fantastic on your site. Jekyll gives you full control on how to style your site and once you have built the main structure of your blog then all the posts after will look great.

How do you start?
Head to the Jekyll website, it has a lot of resources. You can also check Jekyll tips website, that contain video tutorials and templates that will help you start understanding Jekyll and how to build an amazing blog.

First install Jekyll using the following commands:

Then download a Jekyll template, there are a lot on web. Once all that is set, you can start reading the template and modifying it while watch the videos on the Jekyll tips website.

I found that the documentation is really easy to understand and in few hours you can have a site ready for deployment depending of course on the complexity of the site you are trying to build.

I used the dekyll template to get familiar with the format and layout and used some of the code as the basis of this template. If you like my template you can find it at .....

Where to host?
This is the best part. You get freehosting with github pages. No need to worry about finding a hosting company and dealing with it. Your code will be on github and at the same time published to the web. Any changes you push, can show up immediately. You eliminate the deployment process all together.
