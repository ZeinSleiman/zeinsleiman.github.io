2018 was very challenging for me but in a very positive way. I was challenged like I have never been beofre and it allowed me to start a journey of rediscovering myself and digging inside to reignite the fire that has been dimishing bit by bit. One day I might talk about my 2018 year but this is the year where the pheonix rise again. 

2019 Goals:

1. Writing more blogs about code (at least 24)
2. Read 14 books by the end of the year
3. Exercising on a daily basis
4. Meditating on a daily basis
5. Organizing and separating work and home chores
6. Finish 3 side projects I have been postponing for years

These are not much but definitely will help my journey as a new me.
