Last year was very challenging for me but in a very positive way. I was challenged like I have never been beofre and it allowed me to start a journey of rediscovering myself and digging inside to reignite the fire that has been dimishing bit by bit. 

#### 2019 Goals:

- [ ] Writing more blogs about code (at least 24)
- [ ] Read 14 books by the end of the year
- [ ] Exercising on a daily basis
- [ ] Meditating on a daily basis
- [ ] Organizing and separating work and home chores
- [ ] Finish 3 side projects

These are not much but definitely will help my journey.
