Back in 2019, I wrote a blog post called "Looking to rediscover my passion" and I set some goals for myself to achieve. However life in 2019 had a different plan and took me on an amazing journey. It was a great experience that taught me a lot. Now 2020 and with the pandemic going on it is also taking us on a different kind of journey. Hopefully this will end soon and everyone is safe and healthy.
