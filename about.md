# Who I am
I am very passionate about programming and love every aspect of it. The challenge, excitement when solving a problem and the satisfaction when you build software that will be used by others. I am not artistic and I can barely draw a stick man but for me programming is an art. I learned that in this field the amount of material to learn from is infinite and I will keep learning so I can create a difference in people's lives.


# What I do
Currently, I work at Orderbot Software as a Software Engineer. I work on two applications, the order management system and the clients' websites that we build. We use Asp.Net WebForms C#, JQuery, HTML 5, CSS3 and the responsive design Framework Foundation from Zurb.
In my free time, I play football(soccer) as an awesome goalie and try to take advantage of what the beautiful city of Vancover has to offer.


# Little History
I come from Lebanon, where I finished my Masters Degree in Computer and Telecommunication Engineering. I worked for a year as a Technical Consultant. After that I decided to pursue my dream and I came to Vancouver where I finished a two year diploma in Computer System Technology with honours. I graduated in December 2011 and started working in Feb 2012 at Orderbot Software.
